# Random USN Generator
## This is a command line / text based application
## This application can be used to demonstrate the basic database functionality or for your basic DBMS project

This is a simple project written using python and sqlite 

It consists of four important files 
1 main.py\
2 conn.py\
3 insert_usn.py\
4 db_add.py

first using conn.py you need to create the database and tables 
next using db_add.py file you need to add usn to the database you can also change the usn structure using regex inside this file only
next you can run the main.py 

## This is written for linux(ubuntu) if you want to use it in windows please do change somethings like cls instead of clear in main.py and also I used some libraries that doesn't work perfectly inside windows terminal
